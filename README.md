# Spotivar :: WIP music library/player/storage 

We're making something like **Spotify** but a bit more open, nerd-targeted, and, in some way, more functional. Hope you like it!

**It's still very early in its development, so don't expect anything to work, or to use it in such condition, it's nowhere near ready. But you're welcome to help!**

## WIP Visuals

Desired design, but yet not implemented:

## Prerequisites

You need to have `CMake`, `Ninja` and `Clang` installed. You can install them with your distribution's package manager.

For example, on **Arch Linux:** you can do:
```sh
sudo pacman -Sy cmake clang
```

And for **Ubuntu:** 
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y cmake clang ninja-build
```

Then, you need to install 4 libraries this project heavily depends on: `GTKmm3.0`, `Boost`, `Flac` and `Ogg`. You can build all of them from source (it's what I would definitely recommend for the latter two, as their distribution from package manager usually doesn't include files necessary for `CMake` to find them). `Boost`, at the same time, can be usually installed with a package manager perfectly fine:

For example, on **Arch Linux:**
```sh
sudo pacman -Sy boost boost-libs ninja gtkmm3
```

On **Ubuntu:**
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y libboost-all-dev libgtkmm-3.0-dev
```

Building `Ogg` and `Flac` is from source is also quite simple: select directory where you want to install them and `cd` there, this directory can be anywhere on your system, for example, in `/opt/` (beware this directory is usually owned by `root`, you will need to clone with `sudo` and then change owner of the cloned repository to your user with: `sudo chown -R <your-user-name>:<your-usuall-group-usually-has-same-name-as-user> <dir>`).

After you did, you can download and build `Ogg` (it should be built first, as `Flac` depends on it):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/xiph/ogg.git && cd ogg
cmake -B build .
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --build build --target install
```

And then do pretty much the same for `Flac`:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/xiph/flac.git && cd flac
cmake -B build .

# Manpages don't build for some reason, so I disabled them:
cmake --build build -DINSTALL_MANPAGES=OFF 
sudo cmake --build build --target install
```

## Build

You then build it like any other CMake project, from project's root execute:
```sh
# Beware, it uses some Clang extensions to C++, so it won't build with GCC!
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

You can now run project's executable: `./build/src/spotivar`!
